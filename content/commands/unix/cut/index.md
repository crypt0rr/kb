## Cut

## Usage

```plain
cut OPTION... [FILE]...
```

## Flags

```plain
Usage: cut OPTION... [FILE]...
Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
-b, --bytes=LIST select only these bytes
-c, --characters=LIST select only these characters
-d, --delimiter=DELIM use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter
-f, --fields=LIST select only these fields; also print any line
that contains no delimiter character, unless
the -s option is specified
-n (ignored)
--complement complement the set of selected bytes, characters
or fields
-s, --only-delimited do not print lines not containing delimiters
--output-delimiter=STRING use STRING as the output delimiter
the default is to use the input delimiter
-z, --zero-terminated line delimiter is NUL, not newline
--help display this help and exit
--version output version information and exit

Use one, and only one of -b, -c or -f. Each LIST is made up of one
range, or many ranges separated by commas. Selected input is written
in the same order that it is read, and is written exactly once.
Each range is one of:

N N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1
N- from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line
N-M from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field
-M from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field

Cut list of bytes

```plain

```

Cut by fields

```plain

cut -f 2-4 <file>
```

Cut range of fields

```plain
cut -f 1-2,4-5 <file>
```

Cut by delimiter

```plain

```

Cut by delimiter with output delimiter

```plain

E.g. with tab after each field
cut -d '<delimter>' -f <field> --output-delimiter=$'\t' <file>
```
