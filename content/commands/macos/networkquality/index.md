## networkQuality

networkQuality allows for measuring the different aspects of Network Quality, including:

* Maximal capacity (often described as speed)
* The responsiveness of the connection. Responsiveness measures the quality of your network by the number of roundtrips completed per minute (RPM) under working conditions. See <https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212313>
* Other aspects of the connection that affect the quality of experience.

NOTE: This tool will connect to the Internet to perform its tests. This will use data on your Internet service plan.
