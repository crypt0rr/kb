## Dirhunt

Find web directories without bruteforce.

Dirhunt is a web crawler optimize for search and analyze directories. This tool can find interesting things if the server has the "index of" mode enabled. Dirhunt is also useful if the directory listing is not enabled. It detects directories with false 404 errors, directories where an empty index file has been created to hide things and much more.

Dirhunt does not use brute force. But neither is it just a crawler. This tool is faster than others because it minimizes requests to the server. Generally, this tool takes between 5-30 seconds, depending on the website and the server.

Read more about how to use Dirhunt [in the documentation](http://docs.nekmo.org/dirhunt/usage.html).
