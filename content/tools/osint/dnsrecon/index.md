## DNSrecon

DNS Enumeration and Scanning Tool.

## Installation

```plain
git clone https://github.com/darkoperator/dnsrecon.git
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```plain
dnsrecon.py [-h] [-d DOMAIN] [-n NS_SERVER] [-r RANGE] [-D DICTIONARY] [-f] [-a] [-s] [-b] [-y] [-k] [-w] [-z] [--threads THREADS] [--lifetime LIFETIME] [--tcp] [--db DB] [-x XML] [-c CSV] [-j JSON] [--iw]
                   [--disable_check_recursion] [--disable_check_bindversion] [-V] [-v] [-t TYPE]
```

## Flags

```plain
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN
                        Target domain.
  -n NS_SERVER, --name_server NS_SERVER
                        Domain server to use. If none is given, the SOA of the target will be used. Multiple servers can be specified using a comma separated list.
  -r RANGE, --range RANGE
                        IP range for reverse lookup brute force in formats   (first-last) or in (range/bitmask).
  -D DICTIONARY, --dictionary DICTIONARY
                        Dictionary file of subdomain and hostnames to use for brute force.
  -f                    Filter out of brute force domain lookup, records that resolve to the wildcard defined IP address when saving records.
  -a                    Perform AXFR with standard enumeration.

  -y                    Perform Yandex enumeration with standard enumeration.
  -k                    Perform crt.sh enumeration with standard enumeration.
  -w                    Perform deep whois record analysis and reverse lookup of IP ranges found through Whois when doing a standard enumeration.
  -z                    Performs a DNSSEC zone walk with standard enumeration.
  --threads THREADS     Number of threads to use in reverse lookups, forward lookups, brute force and SRV record enumeration.
  --lifetime LIFETIME   Time to wait for a server to respond to a query. default is 3.0
  --tcp                 Use TCP protocol to make queries.
  --db DB               SQLite 3 file to save found records.
  -x XML, --xml XML     XML file to save found records.
  -c CSV, --csv CSV     Save output to a comma separated value file.
  -j JSON, --json JSON  save output to a JSON file.
  --iw                  Continue brute forcing a domain even if a wildcard record is discovered.
  --disable_check_recursion
