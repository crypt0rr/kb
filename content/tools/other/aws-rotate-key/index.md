## aws-rotate-key

As a security best practice, AWS recommends that users periodically regenerate their API access keys. This tool simplifies the rotation of access keys defined in your credentials file.

When run, the program will list the current access keys associated with your IAM user, and print the steps it has to perform to rotate them. It will then wait for your confirmation before continuing.

### Installation

go install github.com/stefansundin/aws-rotate-key@latest
```

aws-rotate-key [OPTIONS]
