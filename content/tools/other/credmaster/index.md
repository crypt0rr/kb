## Credmaster

Launch a password spray / brute force attach via Amazon AWS passthrough proxies, shifting the requesting IP address for every authentication attempt. This dynamically creates FireProx APIs for more evasive password sprays.

Shoutout to @ustayready for his CredKing and FireProx tools, which form the base of this suite.

See all the full notes on the Wiki, tool released with specifics in this blogpost
