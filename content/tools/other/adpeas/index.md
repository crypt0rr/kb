## adPEAS

adPEAS is a Powershell tool to automate Active Directory enumeration. In fact, adPEAS is like a wrapper for different other cool projects like

* PowerView
* Empire
* Bloodhound
* and some own written lines of code

As said, adPEAS is a wrapper for other tools. They are almost all written in pure Powershell but some of them are included as compressed binary blob or C# code.

adPEAS-Light is a version without Bloodhound and vulnerability checks and it is more likely that it will not blocked by an AV solution.

### How It Works

adPEAS can be run simply by starting the script via 'invoke-adPEAS' if it is started on a domain joined computer. If the system you are running adPEAS from is not domain joined or you want to enumerate another domain, use a certain domain controller to connect to, use different credentials or just to enumerate for credential exposure only, you can do it by using defined parameters.

### adPEAS Modules

adPEAS consists of the following enumeration modules:

* Domain - Searching for basic Active Directory information, like Domain Controllers, Sites und Subnets, Trusts and DCSync rights
* CA - Searching for basic Enterprise Certificate Authority information, like CA Name, CA Server and Templates
* Creds - Searching for different kind of credential exposure, like ASREPRoast, Kerberoasting, GroupPolicies, Netlogon scripts, LAPS, gMSA, certain account attributes, e.g. UnixPassword, etc.
* Delegation - Searching for delegation issues, like 'Constrained Delegation', 'Unconstrained Delegation' and 'Resource Based Unconstrained Delegation', for computer and user accounts
* Accounts - Searching for high privileged user accounts in predefined groups, account issues like e.g. password not expire
* Computer - Enumerating Domain Controllers, CA and Exchange server, with the switch -Vulns it checks the systems for EternalBlue, BlueKeep, ZeroLogon and critical Exchange vulnerabilities
* Bloodhound - Enumerating Active Directory with BloodHound
