## EmailSecCheck

EmailSecCheck is a lightweight Python utility that checks whether email security DNS records (DMARC and SPF) are configured properly for a domain. EmailSecCheck is powered by [checkdmarc](https://github.com/domainaware/checkdmarc), and leverages it to identify common misconfigurations in DNS records that may enable for email spoofing.

Email spoofing is identified under the following conditions:

* SPF Issues
  * SPF configured as something other than `fail` or `softfail`
  * SPF record is missing
  * SPF record contains a syntax error
* DMARC Issues
  * Multiple SPF records exist
  * DMARC record is missing
  * DMARC record contains a syntax error
  * Multiple DMARC records exist
