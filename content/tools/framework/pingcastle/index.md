## PingCastle

The risk level regarding Active Directory security has changed. Several vulnerabilities have been made popular with tools like [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) or sites likes [adsecurity.org](http://adsecurity.org/).

PingCastle is a tool designed to assess quickly the Active Directory security level with a methodology based on risk assessment and a maturity framework.
It does not aim at a perfect evaluation but rather as an efficiency compromise.

## Installation

Download latest version from [Github.com](https://github.com/vletoux/pingcastle/releases)

## Usage

```plain
.\PingCastle.exe
```

## Flags

  1-healthcheck-Score the risk of a domain
  2-azuread    -Score the risk of AzureAD
  3-conso      -Aggregate multiple reports into a single one
  4-carto      -Build a map of all interconnected domains
  5-scanner    -Perform specific security checks on workstations
  6-export     -Export users or computers
  7-advanced   -Open the advanced menu
  0-Exit
==============================
This is the main functionnality of PingCastle. In a matter of minutes, it produces a report which will give you an overview of your Active Directory security. This report can be generated on other domains by using the existing trust links.
