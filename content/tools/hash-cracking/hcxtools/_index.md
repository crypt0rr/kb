## hcxtools

**Note**: the tools can be used stand-alone but also in combination with each other. The steps would be:

1. [hcxdumptool]({{< ref "hcxdumptool" >}}) - capturing needed things
2. [hcxpcapngtool]({{< ref "hcxpcapngtool" >}}) - converting to hash file
3. [hcxhashtool]({{< ref "hcxhashtool" >}}) - selecting specific network to crack

Small set of tools convert packets from captures (h = hash, c = capture, convert and calculate candidates, x = different hashtypes) for the use with latest hashcat or John the Ripper. The tools are 100% compatible to hashcat and John the Ripper and recommended by hashcat. This branch is pretty closely synced to hashcat git and John the Ripper git.

* Support of hashcat hash-modes: 4800, 5500, 2200x, 16100, 250x (deprecated), 1680x (deprecated)
* Support of John the Ripper hash-modes: WPAPSK-PMK, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1, chap, netntlm, tacacs-plus
* Support of gzip (.gz) single file compression

Main purpose is to detect weak points within own WiFi networks by analyzing the hashes. Therefore convert the dump file to WPA-PBKDF2-PMKID+EAPOL hash file and check if wlan-key or plainmasterkey was transmitted unencrypted. Or upload the "uncleaned" dump file (pcapng, pcap, cap) here <https://wpa-sec.stanev.org/?submit> to find out if your ap or the client is vulnerable by using common wordlists or a weak password generation algorithm.
