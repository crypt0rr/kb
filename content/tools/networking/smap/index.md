## Smap

passive Nmap like scanner built with shodan.io

Smap is a replica of Nmap which uses shodan.io's free API for port scanning. It takes same command line arguments as Nmap and proudces the same output which makes it a drop-in replacament for Nmap.

## Features

* Scans 200 hosts per second
* Vulnerability detection
* Supports all nmap's output formats
* Service and version fingerprinting
* Makes no contact to the targets
* Doesn't require any account/api key

## Installation

```plain
go install -v github.com/s0md3v/smap/cmd/smap@latest
```

## Usage

Smap takes the same arguments as Nmap but options other than `-p`, `-h`, `-o*`, `-iL` are ignored. If you are unfamiliar with Nmap, here's how to use Smap.

```plain
smap <targets here>
```

### Specifying ports

SMap scans these [1237 ports](https://api.shodan.io/shodan/ports) by default. If you want to display results for certain ports, use the `-p` option.

```plain
smap -p21-30,80,443 -iL targets.txt
```

## Considerations

Since Smap simply fetches existent port data from shodan.io, it is super fast but there's more to it. You should use Smap if:

### You want

* vulnerability detection
* a super fast port scanner
* results for most common ports (top 1237)
* no connections to be made to the targets

### You are okay with

* not being able to scan IPv6 addresses
* results being up to 7 days old
* a few false negatives

## Examples

```plain
$ smap kb.offsec.nl
