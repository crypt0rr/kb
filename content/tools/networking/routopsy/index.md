## Routopsy

Routopsy is a toolkit built to attack often overlooked networking protocols. Routopsy currently supports attacks against Dynamic Routing Protocols (DRP) and First-Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP). Most of the attacks currently implemented make use of a weaponised 'virtual router' as opposed to implementing protocols from scratch. The tooling is not limited to the virtual routers, and allows for further attacks to be implemented in python3 or by adding additional containers.
