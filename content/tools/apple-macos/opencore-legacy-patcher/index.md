## OpenCore Legacy Patcher

A python program for building and booting [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) on both legacy and modern Macs, see our in-depth [Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) for more information.

Supported features:

* System Integrity Protection, FileVault 2, .im4m Secure Boot and Vaulting
* WPA Wifi and Personal Hotspot support
* Native OTA OS DELTA updates on all Macs
* Recovery OS, Safe Mode and Single-user Mode booting
* Zero firmware patching required (ie. APFS ROM patching)
* GPU Switching on MacBook Pro models (2012 and newer)

Note: Only clean-installs and upgrades are supported, macOS Big Sur installs already patched with other patchers, such as [Patched Sur](https://github.com/BenSova/Patched-Sur) or [bigmac](https://github.com/StarPlayrX/bigmac), cannot be used due to broken file integrity with APFS snapshots and SIP.

* You can however reinstall macOS with this patcher and retain your original data

Note 2: Currently OpenCore Legacy Patcher officially supports patching to run macOS Big Sur and Monterey installs. For older OSes, OpenCore may function however support is currently not provided from Dortania.

* For macOS Mojave and Catalina support, we recommend the use of [dosdude1's patchers](http://dosdude1.com)
