## Passepartout

Passepartout is a smart OpenVPN client perfectly integrated with Apple platforms. Passepartout is the only app you need for both well-known OpenVPN providers and your personal OpenVPN servers.

With Trusted Networks, Passepartout unlocks the very best of using a VPN.

Passepartout does not engage any unrequested background activity other than the VPN tunnel, thus being also friendlier to firewalls.

* Presets for multiple providers (virtually any)
* Trusted networks
* Siri shortcuts (iOS)
* Override network settings
* No background activities
* Wise on battery

### Easy to use

* Incredible ease of use, with native look & feel.
* Handle your profiles in one single place.
* Import .ovpn configuration files.
* Use Trusted Networks to fine-grain your connectivity.
* Fine-tune encryption without tweaking any configuration file.
* Override network settings in a snap (default gateway, DNS, proxy, MTU).

### Privacy Friendly

* Full transparency on what servers you're connecting to.
* Pick pre-resolved endpoints when DNS is problematic.
* No web services, ads or any undesired bloat besides the VPN itself.
