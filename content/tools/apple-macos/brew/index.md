## Brew

Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didnâ€™t include with macOS. It can also install software not packaged for your Linux distribution to your home directory without requiring sudo.

## Installation

```plain
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Usage

```plain
brew search TEXT|/REGEX/
brew info [FORMULA|CASK...]
brew install FORMULA|CASK...
brew update
brew upgrade [FORMULA|CASK...]
brew uninstall FORMULA|CASK...
brew list [FORMULA|CASK...]
```

## Flags

```plain
Troubleshooting:
  brew config
  brew doctor
  brew install --verbose --debug FORMULA|CASK
