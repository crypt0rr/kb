## Bartender

Bartender is an award-winning app for macOS that superpowers your menu bar, giving you total control over your menu bar items, what's displayed, and when, with menu bar items only showing when you need them. Bartender improves your workflow with quick reveal, search, custom hotkeys and triggers, and lots more.

### Installation

### Examples

#### Quick Reveal

Lightning-fast access to your menu bar items is now possible with Quick Reveal. Get instant access to your hidden menu bar items simply by moving your mouse to the menu bar, or if you prefer, by clicking the menu bar.

#### Menu Bar Item Spacing

Reduce the space between menu bar items using Bartender, allowing you to have the same spacing as previous macOS versions, or even less, allowing you to have more menu bar items.
