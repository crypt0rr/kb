## Launch Day

**Captain’s Log, 0120 hours**

> ***"No mission too saucy for us!"***  
> – Captain’s official decree

It seems we accidentally loaded a crate of rubber chickens instead of emergency food rations, but the crew is already brainstorming new dance routines with them. Meanwhile, our quartermaster replaced the lifebuoys with giant doughnuts for a "themed" departure—perfect for dunking our morale into sugary bliss.

### Status

- **Reason for voyage:** A midnight run to deliver top-secret cargo (pasta flour and extra marinara).
- **Crew status:**
  - Eager to set sail
  - Full of energy (and possibly leftover breadsticks)

### Early Observations
