Welcome to the legendary 4x4 quarters of Captain Hugo, where navigation charts double as wallpaper and yesterday's coffee cup might contain tomorrow's coordinates! The genuine fake window offers stunning views of wherever the captain thinks we are (he's been known to mistake the Mediterranean for the Caribbean on more than one occasion).

Despite the creative filing system (read: artistic piles), our beloved captain insists he knows exactly where everything is -- including his lucky compass, which has been "temporarily misplaced" for the past three months. The room features state-of-the-art organizational solutions, such as "that chair with all the stuff" and "the corner where important things go."

Visitors are kindly requested to not disturb the delicate ecosystem of nautical instruments, half-written logbooks, and at least seven different types of tea sets -- all carefully arranged in what the captain calls his "systematic randomness."
