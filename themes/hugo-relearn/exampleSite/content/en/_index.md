> **"When {{% badge style="primary" icon="anchor" %}}The Purple Pulpo{{% /badge %}} sets sail, even the fish hold their breath."**  
> – Old fisherman’s tale

The year is 1623. An unusual ship, {{% badge style="primary" icon="anchor" %}}The Purple Pulpo{{% /badge %}}, emerges from the foggy sea, its sails dyed a brilliant purple that dazzles friend and foe alike. Cunning merchants whisper about a legendary octopus figurehead carved from driftwood—some say it dances under moonlight to ward off pesky sea ghosts (and suspicious tax collectors).

## Myths and Rumors

Though many debate its authenticity, rumor has it the captain once successfully traded a shipload of questionable sea cucumbers for a cargo of prized purple velvet. The hue of the velvet supposedly matched the exact shade of the boat—thus reinforcing its flamboyant reputation.

### Possible Explanations

1. A wizard was on board, casting color illusions for fun.
2. The purple paint was accidentally created by mixing octopus ink into the ship’s pigment.
3. Too much wine spilled on deck over _many_ voyages. (Captain’s favorite theory.)

## Unlikely Allies

It is said, one day a rival trading ship, the {{% badge color="hotpink" icon="fa-fw fab fa-gitkraken" %}}Lady Kraken{{% /badge %}}, tried to outdo {{% badge style="primary" icon="anchor" %}}The Purple Pulpo{{% /badge %}} by painting their masts hot pink. The clash at sea was more of a fashion show than a naval battle -- onlookers cheered for hours, forgetting they were late for dinner.
