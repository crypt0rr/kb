### New

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} Support for Hugoâ€™s built-in [`details` shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#details) by mapping it to the theme's [`expand` shortcode](shortcodes/expand).

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} The topbar button for the print format [can now be hidden](authoring/frontmatter/topbar/#print-button) if the print output format is active by setting `disablePrintButton=true` in your `hugo.toml` or Front Matter.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme supports the new [`markdown` output format](configuration/sitemanagement/outputformats/#markdown-support) which behaves similar in configuration as the `print` output format but allows the original Markdown source of a page to be viewed.

  You can see this in action on the above linked page, accessible by clikcking the topbar button.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} Keyboard support for code blocks was improved so the _copy to clipboard_ button is now reachable by <kbd>TAB</kbd> if `disableHoverBlockCopyToClipBoard=false` was set in the `hugo.toml`.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} Futher accessibility impovements were made for the _anchor_, _copy to clipboard_ and _mermaid reset_ functionality by using a HTML `button` instead of a `span`.
