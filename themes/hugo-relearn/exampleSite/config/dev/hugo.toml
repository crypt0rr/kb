# Configuration to create a complete website locally, containing of the docs
# and the exampleSite. This resembles the same structure as the GitHub Pages
#
# 1. Build the docs by either `hugo` or `hugo server`
# 2. Build the exampleSite by `hugo -e dev` or `hugo server -e dev
#`
# After that, a complete website is available in the docs/public folder
# and can be used from the file system. The links between both projects
# will not work as they are pointing the the GitHub Pages copy. So
# for testing you will have to type them manually.

# Standard adjustments for deveolpment, to make this site work
